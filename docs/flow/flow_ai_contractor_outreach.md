# AI Contractor Outreach Process Flow

This document describes the process flow for the AI-powered contractor discovery and outreach system in the InstaBids platform. This system enables automatic identification, qualification, communication, and conversion of potential contractors.

## Process Overview

The AI Contractor Outreach system operates through five main phases:

1. **Discovery**: Identifying potential contractors from various data sources
2. **Enrichment**: Gathering and validating additional data about prospects
3. **Qualification**: Scoring and prioritizing prospects for outreach
4. **Outreach**: Communicating with prospects through various channels
5. **Conversion**: Converting prospects into registered, verified contractors

This process is designed to scale contractor acquisition efforts while maintaining personalization and effectiveness.
