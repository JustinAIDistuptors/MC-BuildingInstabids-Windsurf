# Bidding System Process Flow

This document outlines the comprehensive process flows for the bidding system in the InstaBids platform. It covers the complete bidding lifecycle from opportunity discovery through bid submission, negotiation, acceptance, and contract formation.

## Bid Request-to-Submission Flow

The following sequence diagram illustrates the standard flow from bid request to submission:

## Bid Matching Engine Logic

The system uses a sophisticated matching engine to connect projects with the most suitable contractors:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[New Project] --> B[Extract Project Attributes]
    B --> C[Generate Search Criteria]
    
    C --> D[Location Match]
    C --> E[Category Match]
    C --> F[Budget Range Match]
    C --> G[Schedule Match]
    C --> H[Size/Complexity Match]
    
    D --> I[Apply Contractor Filters]
    E --> I
    F --> I
    G --> I
    H --> I
    
    I --> J[Retrieve Contractor Pool]
    J --> K[Score Each Contractor]
    
    K --> L[Recent Activity Score]
    K --> M[Rating/Reviews Score]
    K --> N[Completion Rate Score]
    K --> O[Response Time Score]
    K --> P[Past Project Similarity]
    K --> Q[Bid-Win Ratio]
    
    L --> R[Calculate Final Score]
    M --> R
    N --> R
    O --> R
    P --> R
    Q --> R
    
    R --> S[Apply Weighting Factors]
    S --> T[Rank Contractors]
    T --> U[Apply Diversity Rules]
    U --> V[Return Ranked List]
    
    style A fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
