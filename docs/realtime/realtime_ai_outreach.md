### Performance Characteristics

The real-time system is designed to meet these key performance metrics:

| Component | Latency Target | Throughput | Reliability |
|-----------|----------------|------------|-------------|
| Event Ingestion | < 50ms | 5,000 events/sec | 99.99% |
| Message Personalization | < 100ms | 500 requests/sec | 99.95% |
| Response Analysis | < 1 second | 100 analyses/sec | 99.9% |
