```typescript
// Example: TypeScript client implementation for real-time payment updates
class PaymentRealTimeClient {
  private socket: WebSocket;
  private eventHandlers: Map<string, Function[]> = new Map();
  private reconnectAttempts = 0;
  private maxReconnectAttempts = 5;

  constructor(private userId: string, private authToken: string) {
    this.connect();
  }
  
  private connect() {
    // Secure connection with authentication
    this.socket = new WebSocket(`wss://api.instabids.com/payments/realtime?token=${this.authToken}`);
    
    this.socket.onopen = () => {
      console.log('Payment real-time connection established');
      this.reconnectAttempts = 0;
      this.reconnectDelay = 1000;
      
      // Subscribe to user-specific payment events
      this.sendMessage({
        type: 'subscribe',
        channels: [
          `user.${this.userId}.payments`,

    this.socket.onclose = (event) => {
      console.log('Payment real-time connection closed', event.code, event.reason);
      
      // Implement exponential backoff for reconnection
      if (this.reconnectAttempts < this.maxReconnectAttempts) {
        setTimeout(() => {
          this.reconnectAttempts++;
          this.reconnectDelay *= 2; // Exponential backoff
          this.connect();
        }, this.reconnectDelay);
      }
    };
    
    this.socket.onerror = (error) => {
      console.error('Payment real-time connection error', error);
    };
  }
  
  private sendMessage(message: any) {

    }
  }
  
  private handleMessage(message: any) {
    const eventType = message.type;
    const handlers = this.eventHandlers.get(eventType) || [];
    
    handlers.forEach(handler => {
      try {
        handler(message.data);
      } catch (error) {
        console.error(`Error in handler for ${eventType}`, error);
      }
    });
  }
  
  // Public API
  public on(eventType: string, handler: Function) {
    const handlers = this.eventHandlers.get(eventType) || [];
    handlers.push(handler);
    this.eventHandlers.set(eventType, handlers);
    return this;
  }
  
  public off(eventType: string, handler?: Function) {
    if (!handler) {

      const index = handlers.indexOf(handler);
      if (index >= 0) {
        handlers.splice(index, 1);
        this.eventHandlers.set(eventType, handlers);
      }
    }
    return this;
  }
  
  public subscribeToPayment(paymentId: string) {
    this.sendMessage({
      type: 'subscribe',
      channels: [`payment.${paymentId}`]
    });
    return this;
  }

}

// Usage example
const paymentClient = new PaymentRealTimeClient('user-123', 'auth-token');

// Listen for specific payment events
paymentClient.on('payment.status_updated', (data) => {
  console.log(`Payment ${data.paymentId} status changed to ${data.newStatus}`);
  // Update UI with new status
  updatePaymentStatusUI(data.paymentId, data.newStatus);
});

// Subscribe to specific payment
paymentClient.subscribeToPayment('payment-456');

// Subscribe to specific milestone
paymentClient.subscribeToMilestone('milestone-789');
```

### Server Implementation

```typescript
// Example: TypeScript server implementation for payment real-time updates
import { WebSocketServer } from 'ws';
import { verifyAuthToken } from './auth';
import { EventEmitter } from 'events';

// Global event bus
const eventBus = new EventEmitter();

// WebSocket server
const wss = new WebSocketServer({ 
  server, // HTTP server instance
  path: '/payments/realtime',
  clientTracking: true
});

// Client connections map
const clients = new Map();

// Handle new WebSocket connections
wss.on('connection', async (ws, req) => {
  try {
    // Extract and verify auth token
    const url = new URL(req.url, `http://${req.headers.host}`);
    const token = url.searchParams.get('token');
    
    if (!token) {
      ws.close(1008, 'Authentication required');
      return;
    }
    
    // Verify token and get user info
    const userData = await verifyAuthToken(token);
    if (!userData) {
      ws.close(1008, 'Invalid authentication');
      return;
    }
    
    // Store client information
    const clientId = userData.userId;
    clients.set(ws, {
      id: clientId,
      subscriptions: new Set([`user.${clientId}.payments`]), // Default subscription
      userData
    });
    
    // Set up ping/pong for connection health monitoring
    ws.isAlive = true;
    ws.on('pong', () => {
      ws.isAlive = true;
    });
    
    // Handle client messages
    ws.on('message', (message) => {
      try {
        const data = JSON.parse(message.toString());
        handleClientMessage(ws, data);
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error processing client message', error);
      }
    });
    
    // Handle client disconnection
    ws.on('close', () => {
      clients.delete(ws);
    });
    
    // Send initial state if needed
    sendInitialState(ws, userData);
    
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('WebSocket connection error', error);
    ws.close(1011, 'Server error');
  }
});

// Handle client messages
function handleClientMessage(ws, message) {
  const client = clients.get(ws);
  if (!client) return;
  
  switch (message.type) {
    case 'subscribe':
      handleSubscribe(ws, client, message);
      break;
    case 'unsubscribe':
      handleUnsubscribe(ws, client, message);
      break;
    // Other message types...
  }
}

// Handle channel subscriptions
function handleSubscribe(ws, client, message) {
  if (!Array.isArray(message.channels)) return;
  
  message.channels.forEach(channel => {
    // Validate channel subscription permissions
    if (canSubscribeToChannel(client, channel)) {
      client.subscriptions.add(channel);
    }
  });
}

// Handle channel unsubscriptions
function handleUnsubscribe(ws, client, message) {
  if (!Array.isArray(message.channels)) return;
  
  message.channels.forEach(channel => {
    client.subscriptions.delete(channel);
  });
}

// Check if client can subscribe to a channel
function canSubscribeToChannel(client, channel) {
  // User-specific channels
  if (channel.startsWith(`user.${client.id}.`)) {
    return true;
  }
  
  // Payment-specific channels
  if (channel.startsWith('payment.')) {
    const paymentId = channel.split('.')[1];
    return hasAccessToPayment(client.id, paymentId);
  }
  
  // Milestone-specific channels
  if (channel.startsWith('milestone.')) {
    const milestoneId = channel.split('.')[1];
    return hasAccessToMilestone(client.id, milestoneId);
  }
  
  // Dispute-specific channels
  if (channel.startsWith('dispute.')) {
    const disputeId = channel.split('.')[1];
    return hasAccessToDispute(client.id, disputeId);
  }
  
  return false;
}

// Broadcast event to subscribed clients
function broadcastEvent(eventType, channel, data) {
  const message = JSON.stringify({
    type: eventType,
    channel,
    data,
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
  });
  
  for (const [ws, client] of clients.entries()) {
    if (ws.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN && client.subscriptions.has(channel)) {
      ws.send(message);
    }
  }
}

// Integration with payment events
eventBus.on('payment.status_updated', (data) => {
  // Broadcast to payment-specific channel
  broadcastEvent('payment.status_updated', `payment.${data.paymentId}`, data);
  
  // Broadcast to user-specific channels
  broadcastEvent('payment.status_updated', `user.${data.payerId}.payments`, data);
  if (data.payeeId) {
    broadcastEvent('payment.status_updated', `user.${data.payeeId}.payments`, data);
  }
});

// Health check interval
const interval = setInterval(() => {
  wss.clients.forEach((ws) => {
    if (ws.isAlive === false) {
      clients.delete(ws);
      return ws.terminate();
    }
    
    ws.isAlive = false;
    ws.ping();
  });
}, 30000);

// Clean up on server shutdown
wss.on('close', () => {
  clearInterval(interval);
});
```

## User Experience Patterns

### 1. Progressive Loading & Status Indicators

Real-time payment interfaces use progressive loading and status indicators to provide immediate feedback during payment processes.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Progressive Payment UI"
        S1[Initial State] --> S2[Processing State]
        S2 --> S3[Verification State]
        S3 --> S4[Completion State]
        
        S2 --> E1[Error State]
        S3 --> E1
    end
    
    subgraph "UI Components"
        C1[Progress Indicator]
        C2[Status Message]
        C3[Animated Icons]
        C4[Action Buttons]
    end
    
    S1 --> C1 & C2 & C4
    S2 --> C1 & C2 & C3
    S3 --> C1 & C2 & C3
    S4 --> C1 & C2 & C3 & C4
    E1 --> C1 & C2 & C4
```

Guidelines for implementing progressive loading:

1. **Immediate Feedback**
   - Show status changes immediately, even before server confirmation
   - Use optimistic UI updates with fallback patterns
   - Provide clear visual indication of processing state

2. **Contextual Information**
   - Display relevant information for each payment state
   - Show estimated time to completion when available
   - Provide context-specific guidance during waiting periods

3. **Error Recovery**
   - Present clear error messages with recovery actions
   - Maintain state during error recovery attempts
   - Provide alternative payment options when appropriate

### 2. Real-Time Financial Dashboard Components

Dashboards display live financial data with automatic updates and visual indicators for changes.

| Component | Purpose | Update Frequency | Visual Indicators |
|-----------|---------|------------------|-------------------|
| Payment Activity Feed | Show recent payment activities | Real-time | Highlight new entries, animation |
| Balance Indicators | Display current account balances | Real-time | Color change, subtle animation on update |
| Payment Due Timeline | Show upcoming payment obligations | Real-time + Daily | Countdown, urgency indicators |
| Transaction Status Cards | Display status of recent transactions | Real-time | Progress indicators, status icons |
| Milestone Payment Tracker | Track milestone payment status | Real-time | Progress bars, status transitions |

### 3. Mobile-Specific Real-Time Features

Mobile applications require specialized real-time payment features to accommodate mobile usage patterns.

| Feature | Description | Implementation Considerations |
|---------|-------------|-------------------------------|
| Push Notifications | Immediate alerts for payment events | Silent vs. visible notifications based on importance |
| Background Sync | Synchronize payment data when app is in background | Battery optimization, sync frequency tuning |
| Offline Queuing | Queue payment actions during offline periods | Local data consistency, conflict resolution |
| Biometric Verification | Real-time biometric auth for transactions | Quick authentication flow for payment approval |
| Gesture-Based Controls | Swipe gestures for payment approvals/rejections | Simple, intuitive gestures with confirmation |

## Performance Considerations

### 1. Message Optimization

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Payload Optimization"
        P1[Minimal Data Structure]
        P2[Field Filtering]
        P3[Data Compression]
        P4[Binary Protocols]
    end
    
    subgraph "Delivery Optimization"
        D1[Event Batching]
        D2[Priority Queueing]
        D3[Selective Broadcasting]
        D4[Rate Limiting]
    end
    
    subgraph "Connection Optimization"
        C1[Connection Pooling]
        C2[Heartbeat Management]
        C3[Reconnection Strategies]
        C4[Connection Sharing]
    end
    
    P1 & P2 & P3 & P4 --> Performance
    D1 & D2 & D3 & D4 --> Performance
    C1 & C2 & C3 & C4 --> Performance
```

Key optimization strategies:

1. **Payload Size Reduction**
   - Use compact data structures (minimal field names, efficient types)
   - Filter unnecessary fields based on subscription type
   - Compress messages for larger payloads
   - Consider binary formats for high-frequency updates

2. **Selective Broadcasting**
   - Send updates only to clients who need the information
   - Implement fine-grained subscription models
   - Use delta updates for incremental changes
   - Batch non-critical updates to reduce message frequency

3. **Connection Management**
   - Implement connection sharing across features
   - Use heartbeats to maintain connection health
   - Optimize reconnection strategies with backoff
   - Consider connection pooling for server resources

    subgraph "Client Tier"
        C1[Web Clients]
        C2[Mobile Clients]
        C3[API Clients]
    end
    
    subgraph "Gateway Tier"
        G1[WebSocket Gateway 1]
        G2[WebSocket Gateway 2]
        G3[WebSocket Gateway n]
    end

        P2[Event Processor 2]
        P3[Event Processor n]
    end
    
    subgraph "Data Tier"
        D1[Event Store]
        D2[State Store]
    end
    
    C1 & C2 & C3 --> G1 & G2 & G3
    G1 & G2 & G3 --> MB1 & MB2 & MB3
    MB1 & MB2 & MB3 --> P1 & P2 & P3
    P1 & P2 & P3 --> D1 & D2
```

Scalability design patterns:

1. **Horizontal Scaling**
   - Stateless WebSocket gateways behind load balancers
   - Distributed message broker clusters
   - Partitioned event processors by client segment
   - Sharded data stores for state management

2. **Partition Strategies**
   - User-based partitioning for personal payment data
   - Project-based partitioning for milestone payments
   - Geographic partitioning for regional payment methods
   - Time-based partitioning for historical data

3. **Load Management**
   - Rate limiting for high-frequency clients
   - Backpressure mechanisms for traffic spikes
   - Priority queuing for critical payment events
   - Circuit breakers for dependency failures

### 3. Resource Utilization

| Resource Type | Usage Pattern | Optimization Strategy | Monitoring Metrics |
|---------------|---------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| WebSocket Connections | Long-lived, persistent | Connection pooling, session sharing | Connection count, lifetime, error rate |
| Message Processing | Burst patterns around payment events | Worker scaling, priority processing | Queue depth, processing time, error rate |
| State Management | Read-heavy with write spikes | Caching, read replicas, eventual consistency | Cache hit ratio, query time, consistency lag |
| Notification Delivery | Fan-out pattern to multiple recipients | Batching, asynchronous delivery | Delivery time, success rate, queue size |

## Integration Patterns

### 1. Integration with Notification System

Real-time payment events integrate with the platform's notification system to provide alerts across multiple
