That's all right now.# Social Sharing & Referrals Mobile Strategy Documentation

This document outlines the mobile strategy for the Social Sharing & Referrals domain of the InstaBids platform. It covers mobile-specific considerations, implementation approaches, and optimization strategies to ensure a seamless user experience across mobile devices.

## Overview

The Social Sharing & Referrals domain plays a critical role in the mobile experience of the InstaBids platform. Mobile users are particularly likely to engage with social features, share content, and participate in referral programs. This document defines how these features will be implemented for mobile platforms while addressing mobile-specific challenges.

## Mobile User Experience Goals

### Primary Goals

   - Enable one-tap sharing to popular platforms
   - Minimize steps required to generate and share referral codes
   - Provide native sharing experiences on each mobile platform

2. **Seamless Referral Process**
   - Support deep linking for direct referral attribution
   - Enable app-to-app transitions without context loss
   - Provide real-time visibility into referral status

3. **Optimized Content**
   - Auto-format shared content for mobile viewing
   - Optimize images and media for mobile bandwidth
   - Ensure readability and usability on small screens

## Platform Support Strategy

### Native Mobile Applications

| Platform | Support Level | Features | Implementation Approach |
|----------|--------------|----------|-------------------------|

```

The feature parity approach follows these principles:

1. **Essential Features** (100% parity across all platforms)
   - Core referral functionality
   - Basic sharing capabilities
   - Referral status tracking
   - Reward claiming

2. **Enhanced Features** (100% parity on native apps, 80%+ on PWA)
   - Rich media sharing
   - Social account connections
   - Enhanced analytics
   - Gamification elements

3. **Platform-Specific Features** (Leverage unique capabilities of each platform)
   - iOS: ShareSheet, App Clips, iMessage sharing
   - Android: Intent system, App Shortcuts, Direct Share

## Mobile-Specific Technical Implementations

### Deep Linking Architecture

Deep links are crucial for the referral system, enabling direct attribution when a user clicks a referral link on a mobile device.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User1 as Referrer
    participant App1 as Referrer App
    participant SocialPlatform
    participant User2 as Referee
    participant Browser
    participant App2 as Referee App
    participant Backend
    
    User1->>App1: Generates referral
    App1->>App1: Create deep link with referral code
    App1->>SocialPlatform: Share deep link
    SocialPlatform->>User2: Display shared content
    User2->>SocialPlatform: Click shared link
    SocialPlatform->>Browser: Open deep link
    
    alt App Installed
        Browser->>App2: Redirect to app with referral data
        App2->>Backend: Register referral attribution
    else App Not Installed
        Browser->>Browser: Open app store / web experience
        Browser->>Backend: Track click with temporary cookie
        User2->>App2: Install and open app
        App2->>Backend: Complete attribution with install data
    end
    
    Backend->>App1: Notify referrer of conversion
    Backend->>App2: Apply referral benefits
```

**Implementation Details:**

1. **Universal Links (iOS) / App Links (Android)**
   - Configure associated domains for direct app opening
   - Fall back to web experience if app not installed
   - Preserve referral parameters across install process

2. **Deferred Deep Linking**
   - Track referral clicks before app installation
   - Maintain attribution through installation process
   - Resolve attribution upon first app launch

3. **Deep Link Data Structure**
   ```
   instabids://referral?code=REF123&source=facebook&campaign=spring2025&referrer=user456
   ```

### Mobile Share Flow Optimizations

The mobile sharing flow is optimized for quick, contextual sharing while preserving all tracking capabilities:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Context] --> B{Content Type}
    B -->|Project| C[Project Share Flow]
    B -->|Referral| D[Referral Share Flow]
    B -->|Testimonial| E[Testimonial Share Flow]
    
    C --> F{Platform Selection}
    D --> F
    E --> F
    
    F --> G[Native Share Sheet]
    F --> H[Direct Platform SDK]
    
    G --> I[Content Customization]
    H --> I
    
    I --> J[Share Action]
    J --> K[Attribution Tracking]
    K --> L[Engagement Monitoring]
```

**Mobile-Optimized Share Content Structure:**

1. **Project Sharing**
   - Thumbnail image optimized for mobile (responsive sizing)
   - Brief, impactful description (first 80 characters crucial)
   - Clear call-to-action button
   - UTM parameters for attribution

2. **Referral Sharing**
   - Personalized message templates (character-count optimized)
   - Single-tap referral code copying
   - Suggested contacts integration
   - Preview of reward information

3. **Testimonial Sharing**
