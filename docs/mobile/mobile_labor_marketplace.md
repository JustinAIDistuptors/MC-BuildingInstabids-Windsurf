# Labor Marketplace Mobile Strategy

This document outlines the mobile strategy for the Labor Marketplace domain within InstaBids, focusing on the unique requirements and user experiences for both helpers and clients accessing the platform through mobile devices.

## Strategic Importance of Mobile

The Labor Marketplace has particularly critical mobile requirements due to its real-world, on-the-go nature:

1. **Helpers are predominantly mobile**: Labor helpers are frequently traveling between job sites, making mobile their primary platform for engagement
2. **Location verification is essential**: Mobile provides GPS capabilities for verifying on-site presence
3. **Real-time availability is crucial**: Both helpers and clients need real-time status updates and notifications
4. **Photo documentation**: Job site documentation and completion evidence requires camera access
5. **Time-sensitive responses**: Quick application and hiring decisions drive success
