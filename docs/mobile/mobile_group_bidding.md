# Group Bidding Mobile Strategy

This document outlines the mobile strategy for the Group Bidding domain of the InstaBids platform. It covers mobile-specific features, user experience considerations, technical implementation, and synchronization patterns to enable effective team collaboration on mobile devices.

## Overview

The Group Bidding mobile strategy enables contractors to form teams, collaborate on complex bids, and make consensus-driven decisions from their mobile devices. Mobile access is critical for this domain as contractors are often on job sites with limited access to desktop computers.

## UI/UX Design Principles

### 1. One-Handed Operation

The Group Bidding mobile interface is designed for one-handed operation whenever possible, recognizing that contractors often need their other hand free while on job sites.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Bottom Navigation] --> B[Reachable Action Buttons]
    B --> C[Swipe Gestures]
    C --> D[Critical Controls in Thumb Zone]
    D --> E[Adaptive Button Sizing]
```

Key implementations:
- Primary action buttons positioned within thumb reach
- Swipe gestures for common actions like approving components
- Bottom navigation bar with essential functions
- Pull-down refresh and contextual actions

### 2. Glanceable Information

Information is presented in a way that contractors can quickly understand while on the move or in bright outdoor conditions.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[High Contrast Display] --> B[Status Indicators]
    B --> C[Progress Visualizations]
    C --> D[Notification Prioritization]
    D --> E[Critical Alerts]
```

Key implementations:
- Color-coded status indicators for team and component states
- Progress bars for team formation and decision consensus
- Priority-based notification system
- Large touch targets for essential functions

### 3. Progressive Disclosure

Interface complexity scales based on the user's context and current task.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Context-Aware Views] --> B[Task-Based UI]
    B --> C[Expandable Details]
    C --> D[Hierarchical Information]
    D --> E[Just-in-Time Instructions]
```

Key implementations:
- Primary views show essential information only
- Details accessible through expandable sections
- Step-by-step wizards for complex processes
- Contextual help based on current task

### 4. Consistent Cross-Platform Experience

While optimized for mobile, the experience maintains consistency with desktop for contractors who switch between devices.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Shared Mental Models] --> B[Consistent Terminology]
    B --> C[Similar Workflows]
    C --> D[Synchronized State]
    D --> E[Continuity Between Devices]
```

Key implementations:
- Seamless transition between mobile and desktop interfaces
- Consistent visual language and interaction patterns
- Reliable synchronization across devices
- Ability to start tasks on one device and continue on another

## Responsive Design Strategy

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Offline Architecture

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Client Side"
        UI[Mobile UI]
        LocalStore[(Local Storage)]
        SyncEngine[Sync Engine]
        ChangeTracker[Change Tracker]
    end
    
    subgraph "Server Side"
        API[Group Bidding API]
        RemoteDB[(Remote Database)]
        ConflictResolver[Conflict Resolution]
        EventBus[Event Bus]
    end
    
    UI <--> LocalStore
    LocalStore <--> SyncEngine
    UI --> ChangeTracker
    ChangeTracker --> LocalStore
    SyncEngine <--> API
    API <--> RemoteDB
    SyncEngine <--> ConflictResolver
    API --> EventBus
    EventBus --> API
```

The offline architecture uses:

1. **Local Data Store**:
   - Bidirectional sync with server when online
   - Complete CRUD operations against local store
   - SQLite database for structured data
   - File-based storage for media assets

2. **Change Tracking**:
   - Event sourcing approach to track all changes
   - Timestamp and vector clock for change ordering
   - Unique device identifier for change attribution

3. **Conflict Resolution**:
   - Automated resolution for non-conflicting changes
   - Three-way merge for conflicting text changes
   - Last-writer-wins with notification for simple fields
   - Manual resolution option for complex conflicts

4. **Sync Prioritization**:
   - Critical data synced first (decisions, team changes)
   - Background sync for large media assets
   - Configurable sync policies based on network type

### 2. Real-time Collaboration

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Mobile App"
        UI[User Interface]
        LocalState[Local State]
        RTClient[Realtime Client]
        NotificationHandler[Notification Handler]
    end
    
    subgraph "Backend"
        WSGateway[WebSocket Gateway]
        RTDB[(Realtime Database)]
        PubSub[Pub/Sub Service]
        PushService[Push Notification Service]
    end
    
    UI <--> LocalState
    LocalState <--> RTClient
    RTClient <--> WSGateway
    WSGateway <--> RTDB
    RTDB <--> PubSub
    PubSub --> PushService
    PushService --> NotificationHandler
    NotificationHandler --> LocalState
```

The real-time system implements:

1. **WebSocket Connection**:
   - Persistent connection when app is in foreground
   - Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
   - Heartbeat mechanism to detect connection issues

2. **State Synchronization**:
   - Real-time component editing with operational transforms
   - Optimistic UI updates with server confirmation
   - Delta-based updates to minimize bandwidth

3. **Push Notification Fallback**:
   - Critical updates delivered via push when app is in background
   - Notification triage based on user preferences
   - Deep linking from notifications to relevant app section

4. **Presence Awareness**:
   - Team member online/offline status
   - "Currently editing" indicators for components
   - Last seen timestamp for offline members

### 3. Performance Optimizations

graph TD
    A[Data Prefetching] --> B[Component Virtualization]
    B --> C[Progressive Image Loading]
    C --> D[Background Processing]
    D --> E[Memory Management]
```

1. **Efficient Data Loading**:
   - Predictive prefetching based on user behavior
   - Incremental loading of large component lists
   - Data pagination with infinite scroll

2. **Resource Management**:
   - Aggressive image compression for site photos
   - On-demand loading of non-critical assets
   - Cache eviction policies based on usage patterns

3. **Battery Optimization**:
   - Reduced polling frequency when on battery
   - Batched network requests
   - Optimized location services usage

4. **Memory Efficiency**:
   - Component recycling in long lists
   - Memory-conscious image handling
   - State management optimized for mobile constraints

### 4. Security Considerations

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Encrypted Local Storage] --> B[Secure Authentication]
    B --> C[Session Management]
    C --> D[Data Access Control]
    D --> E[Secure Communication]
```

1. **Local Data Protection**:
   - Encrypted SQLite database
   - Secure file storage for component assets
   - Automatic data purging based on retention policy

2. **Authentication & Authorization**:
   - Biometric authentication option
   - OAuth 2.0 with PKCE for API access
   - Role-based access control for team resources

3. **Secure Communication**:
   - Certificate pinning for API connections
   - Encrypted WebSocket connections
   - Signed API requests
