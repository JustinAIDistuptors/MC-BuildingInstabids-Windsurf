## Integration Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge: Maintaining Prospect Data Quality
- **Issue**: Poor-quality prospect data leads to wasted outreach efforts and low conversion rates
- **Solution**: Implement validation at each enrichment stage with confidence scoring and progressive enhancement
- **Integration Point**: AI Enrichment Engine integrates with external data services through validation APIs

### Challenge: Message Deliverability
- **Issue**: Email or SMS messages not reaching prospects due to delivery issues
- **Solution**: Implement delivery status tracking with automatic retries and channel switching
- **Integration Point**: Bidirectional integration with Messaging Domain for status updates

### Challenge: Cross-Domain Event Reliability
- **Issue**: Lost events causing inconsistent state between domains
- **Solution**: Implement event sourcing and replay capabilities with at-least-once delivery guarantee
- **Integration Point**: Event bus with persistent storage and acknowledgment tracking

### Challenge: Rate Limiting on External APIs
- **Issue**: External rate limits restricting AI discovery and enrichment throughput
- **Solution**: Implement adaptive throttling, batching, and priority queuing for API requests
- **Integration Point**: API Gateway with rate limiting policies

## Implementation Considerations

### Synchronization Strategy
- Use eventual consistency model for cross-domain data
- Critical paths (e.g., contractor conversion) use synchronous APIs with retry logic
- Non-critical paths (e.g., analytics updates) use asynchronous events

### Error Handling
- Circuit breaker pattern for external API dependencies
- Dead letter queues for failed events with manual/automated recovery
- Comprehensive error logging with correlation IDs across domain boundaries

### Monitoring & Observability
- Distributed tracing across domain boundaries using OpenTelemetry
- Custom metrics for integration health and performance
- Alerting on integration failure patterns

## Security Considerations

### Authentication & Authorization
- OAuth2 for API authentication between domains
- Service accounts with limited permissions for AI Outreach services
- Fine-grained access control for sensitive prospect data

### Data Protection
- End-to-end encryption for prospect personally identifiable information (PII)
- Automated data retention policies with scheduled anonymization
- Audit logging for all access to prospect data

### Compliance
- GDPR-compliant data handling for prospect information
- Consent tracking for outreach communications
- Data subject access request (DSAR) support across domain boundaries
