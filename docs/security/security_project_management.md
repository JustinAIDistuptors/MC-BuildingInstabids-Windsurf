# Project Management Domain Security Documentation

This document outlines the security considerations, implementation guidelines, and policies for the Project Management domain within the InstaBids platform. It covers access controls, data protection, authentication requirements, and security validation procedures.

## Security Overview

The Project Management domain contains sensitive data including contract details, payment information, personal information of homeowners and contractors, project documentation, and financial records. Proper security measures are essential to ensure data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

## Access Control Model

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Project Management implements RBAC with the following roles and their associated permissions:

| Role | Description | Access Level |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| Project Owner (Homeowner) | The user who created the project | Full access to their own projects and associated data |
| Contractor | The user hired to complete the project | Access to project details, but limited modification rights |
| Project Manager | User assigned to oversee the project | Elevated access for conflict resolution and management |
| Platform Admin | InstaBids administrative user | System-wide access for support purposes |
| Helper | Laborers assigned to project tasks | Limited access to task information only |

## Implementation

### Supabase Row-Level Security (RLS) Policies

Implement the following RLS policies in the database tables:

#### Projects Table

```sql
-- Allow users to see their own projects (either as owner or contractor)
CREATE POLICY projects_select_own ON projects
  FOR SELECT USING (
    auth.uid() = homeowner_id OR 
    auth.uid() = contractor_id OR
    auth.uid() IN (
      SELECT id FROM users WHERE role = 'admin'
    ) OR
    auth.uid() IN (
      SELECT project_manager_id FROM projects WHERE id = projects.id
    )
  );

-- Allow project owners to update their own projects
CREATE POLICY projects_update_owner ON projects
  FOR UPDATE USING (
    auth.uid() = homeowner_id OR
    auth.uid() IN (
      SELECT id FROM users WHERE role = 'admin'
    ) OR
    auth.uid() IN (
      SELECT project_manager_id FROM projects WHERE id = projects.id
    )
  );

-- Allow project owners to delete their own projects (if in draft status)
CREATE POLICY projects_delete_owner ON projects
  FOR DELETE USING (
    (auth.uid() = homeowner_id AND status = 'planning') OR
    auth.uid() IN (SELECT id FROM users WHERE role = 'admin')
  );
```

#### Project Phases Table

```sql
-- Allow access to project phases for project participants
CREATE POLICY phases_select_participants ON project_phases
  FOR SELECT USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM projects 
      WHERE 
        projects.id = project_phases.project_id AND 
        (
          auth.uid() = projects.homeowner_id OR 
          auth.uid() = projects.contractor_id OR
          auth.uid() = projects.project_manager_id OR
          auth.uid() IN (SELECT id FROM users WHERE role = 'admin')
        )
    )
  );

-- Allow contractors to update phase status
CREATE POLICY phases_update_contractor ON project_phases
  FOR UPDATE USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM projects 
      WHERE 
        projects.id = project_phases.project_id AND 
        (
          auth.uid() = projects.contractor_id OR
          auth.uid() = projects.project_manager_id OR
          auth.uid() IN (SELECT id FROM users WHERE role = 'admin')
        )
    )
  );
```

### Sensitive Data Protection

For sensitive data in the Project Management domain:

1. **Financial Information:**
   - Encrypt payment amounts, transaction IDs, and payment methods using AES-256 encryption
   - Mask partial information when displayed in UI (e.g., showing only last 4 digits of payment methods)
   - Store payment tokens rather than actual payment information when possible

2. **Contract Documents:**
   - Encrypt document storage with unique encryption keys per document
   - Implement document watermarking with access information
   - Maintain comprehensive access logs for document views and downloads

3. **Personal Information:**
   - Minimize personal data storage within project records
   - Reference user IDs when possible instead of storing personal contact information directly
   - Implement field-level encryption for sensitive contact information when required

### API Security

1. **Authentication Requirements:**
   - All Project Management API endpoints require valid JWT authentication
   - JWTs must include appropriate role claims for authorization decisions
   - Token expiration set to 1 hour with refresh token support
   - User sessions invalidated upon password change or suspicious activity

2. **API Rate Limiting:**
   - General authenticated endpoints: 60 requests per minute
   - Creation/modification endpoints: 30 requests per minute
   - Payment-related endpoints: 10 requests per minute

3. **Input Validation:**
   - Strict schema validation against all input parameters
   - Sanitization of free-text fields to prevent XSS attacks
   - Validation of file uploads with virus scanning before storage

## Security Validation Procedures

### Automated Security Testing

1. **API Security Testing:**
   - Regular OWASP ZAP scans against Project Management API endpoints
   - Authenticated and unauthenticated testing scenarios
   - Testing for privilege escalation vulnerabilities

2. **Database Security Testing:**
   - Validation of RLS policy effectiveness
   - Testing for SQL injection vulnerabilities
   - Verification of encryption implementation

### Manual Security Testing

1. **Role-Based Access Control Testing:**
   - Manual testing of user role transitions and permission changes
   - Verification of proper access limitations across user types
   - Testing of administrative override capabilities

2. **Business Logic Testing:**
   - Validation of critical business flows like payment authorizations
   - Testing of approval workflows and multi-party confirmations
   - Verification of state transition restrictions

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Procedures

1. **Unauthorized Access to Project Data:**
   - Immediate notification to affected project participants
   - Temporary project freeze until security assessment is complete
   - Audit trail analysis to determine access scope and potential data exposure

2. **Payment Security Incidents:**
   - Immediate payment processing suspension
   - Notification to financial partners and affected parties
   - Root cause analysis and remediation before restoring payment functionality

## Compliance Requirements

### Regulatory Considerations

1. **Financial Data Handling:**
   - Compliance with PCI-DSS for payment processing information
   - Implementation of financial data retention policies (7-year minimum)
   - Audit trails for all financial transactions

2. **Contract Documents:**
   - Electronic signature compliance (ESIGN Act, UETA)
   - Document retention policies based on contract types
   - Immutable storage for legally binding agreements

3. **Personal Data Protection:**
   - GDPR compliance for EU users
   - CCPA compliance for California residents
   - Data minimization and purpose limitation principles

## Security Monitoring

### Alerting Rules

1. **Suspicious Activity Alerts:**
   - Multiple failed login attempts to project management interface
   - Unusual access patterns (time of day, geographic location)
   - Rapid project status changes or payment authorization attempts

2. **Data Access Monitoring:**
   - Alerts for bulk project data access
   - Monitoring of sensitive document access
   - Tracking of payment information viewing

### Logging Requirements

The following events must be logged for security monitoring:

1. **Access Logs:**
   - Project data access timestamps and user IDs
   - File download events with user context
   - API calls to sensitive endpoints (payment, contract)

2. **Modification Logs:**
   - Project status changes with before/after values
   - Financial detail modifications with user attribution
   - Contract document changes with version control

3. **Authentication Logs:**
   - Login attempts (successful and failed)
   - Token issuance and refresh events
   - Permission elevation or role change events

## Implementation Recommendations

### Security Best Practices

1. **Authentication:**
   - Implement MFA for project management access
   - Require strong passwords with regular rotation
   - Use secure HTTP-only cookies for session management

2. **Authorization:**
   - Implement authorization checks at both API and database levels
   - Use principle of least privilege for all user roles
   - Regularly audit permission assignments

3. **Encryption:**
   - Use TLS 1.3 for all API communications
   - Implement envelope encryption for sensitive stored data
   - Secure key management with regular rotation

### Third-Party Integration Security

When integrating with external services (payment processors, document storage):

1. **API Security:**
   - Use secure API keys with limited permissions
   - Implement IP whitelisting where possible
   - Validate all responses from third-party services

2. **Data Sharing:**
   - Share minimal required data with third parties
   - Implement data cleanup procedures post-integration
   - Maintain audit trails of all shared information

## Security Update Process

1. **Regular Security Reviews:**
   - Quarterly review of Project Management domain security controls
   - Annual penetration testing of critical project functions
   - Biannual review of encryption implementations

2. **Security Patch Management:**
   - Critical vulnerabilities addressed within 24 hours
   - High-risk vulnerabilities addressed within 72 hours
   - Medium-risk vulnerabilities addressed within 1 week
