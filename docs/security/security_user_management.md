## Authentication Architecture

### Authentication Methods

The User Management domain implements a defense-in-depth approach to authentication with multiple methods:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Primary Authentication"
        P1[Password Authentication]
        P2[Social Identity Providers]
        P3[Magic Link Email Authentication]
    end
    
    subgraph "Multi-Factor Authentication"
        MFA1[Time-based OTP]
        MFA2[Push Notifications]
        MFA3[SMS Verification]
        MFA4[Hardware Security Keys]
    end
    
    subgraph "Contextual Authentication"
        C1[Location-based Verification]
        C2[Device Fingerprinting]
        C3[Behavioral Analysis]
        C4[Login Velocity Checks]
    end
    
    P1 & P2 & P3 --> MFA1 & MFA2 & MFA3 & MFA4
    MFA1 & MFA2 & MFA3 & MFA4 --> C1 & C2 & C3 & C4
```

#### Primary Authentication Methods

| Method | Implementation | Security Considerations | Recovery Mechanism |
|--------|----------------|-------------------------|-------------------|
| Password Authentication | Argon2id hashing with per-user salt | Minimum complexity requirements, breach database checking | Email-based recovery with verification challenges |
| Social Identity Providers | OAuth 2.0 with PKCE flow | Limited permission scopes, ID token validation | Alternative authentication method |
| Magic Link Email Authentication | Time-limited signed tokens | Short expiration, single-use, link binding | Alternative authentication method |

#### Multi-Factor Authentication

| Method | Implementation | Security Considerations | Recovery Mechanism |
|--------|----------------|-------------------------|-------------------|
| Time-based OTP | RFC 6238 TOTP implementation | Secure seed storage, time drift handling | Backup codes, alternative MFA method |
| Push Notifications | Public key-based signed challenges | Device attestation, connection verification | Alternative MFA method, backup codes |
| SMS Verification | One-time codes via SMS | SIM swapping risks, rate limiting | Alternative MFA method, backup codes |
| Hardware Security Keys | FIDO2/WebAuthn standard | Phishing resistance, strong attestation | Backup security key, alternative MFA |

#### Contextual Authentication

| Factor | Implementation | Security Enhancement | User Experience Impact |
|--------|----------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Location-based Verification | IP geolocation with historical comparison | Step-up auth for unusual locations | Additional verification in ~5% of logins |
| Device Fingerprinting | Canvas fingerprinting, hardware signals | Step-up auth for new devices | Additional verification for new devices |
| Behavioral Analysis | Typing patterns, interaction model | Risk scoring to trigger additional verification | Transparent except in high-risk cases |
| Login Velocity Checks | Time-distance analysis between logins | Block impossible travel patterns | Rare verification prompts |

### Session Management

    participant AuthService
    participant TokenService
    participant ResourceService
    
    User->>Client: Login attempt
    Client->>AuthService: Authentication request
    AuthService->>AuthService: Validate credentials
    AuthService->>TokenService: Request access & refresh tokens
    TokenService->>TokenService: Generate JWT tokens
    TokenService->>Client: Return tokens
    Client->>Client: Store tokens securely
    
    loop Active Session
        Client->>ResourceService: Request with access token
        ResourceService->>ResourceService: Validate token
        ResourceService->>Client: Resource response
        
        Note over Client,TokenService: Token expiration approaching
        Client->>TokenService: Refresh token request
        TokenService->>TokenService: Validate refresh token
        TokenService->>TokenService: Generate new access token
        TokenService->>Client: Return new access token
    end
    
    User->>Client: Logout request
    Client->>AuthService: Invalidate session
    AuthService->>TokenService: Revoke tokens
    Client->>Client: Clear tokens
```

#### Token Architecture

1. **Access Tokens**
   - Short-lived JWT (15 minutes)
   - Stateless validation
   - Contains user ID, roles, permissions
   - Signed with RS256

2. **Refresh Tokens**
   - Longer-lived (7 days)
   - Securely stored in HTTPOnly, Secure cookies
   - Single-use with automatic rotation
   - Server-side invalidation capability

3. **ID Tokens**
   - Contains user identity information
   - Used for client-side personalization
   - Short lifespan synchronized with access token

#### Session Security Controls

| Control | Implementation | Purpose |
|---------|----------------|---------|
| Token Binding | Device fingerprint inclusion in token | Prevent token replay across devices |
| Absolute Session Limits | 7-day maximum session lifetime | Limit exposure from compromised tokens |
| Activity Timeouts | 30-minute inactivity timeout | Reduce risk from unattended sessions |
| Concurrent Session Management | Session registry with visibility & revocation | Control and limit active sessions |
| Forced Re-authentication | Periodic re-auth for sensitive operations | Defense in depth for critical actions |

### Password Policy and Management

```mermaid

    end
    
    PC1 & PC2 & PC3 --> PS1 & PS2 & PS3
    PS1 & PS2 & PS3 --> PL1 & PL2 & PL3
```

#### Password Requirements

| Requirement | Implementation | Rationale |
|-------------|----------------|-----------|
| Minimum Length | 12 characters | Resist brute force attacks |
| Complexity | zxcvbn scoring algorithm (min score 3) | Focus on entropy rather than character classes |
| Breach Database | Check against HaveIBeenPwned API | Prevent use of known compromised passwords |
| Allowed Pattern | No email/name/obvious patterns | Prevent easily guessable passwords |

#### Password Storage

| Technique | Implementation | Security Benefit |
|-----------|----------------|-----------------|
| Hashing Algorithm | Argon2id with tuned parameters | Memory-hard algorithm resistant to specialized hardware |
| Salting | Random per-user 16-byte salt | Prevent rainbow table attacks |
| Peppering | Application-wide encryption key | Additional protection if database is compromised |
| Work Factor | Tuned for 250ms on server hardware | Balance security vs. performance |

#### Password Reset Process

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Client
    participant AuthService
    participant TokenService
    participant EmailService
    
    User->>Client: Request password reset
    Client->>AuthService: Initiate reset flow
    AuthService->>AuthService: Verify account exists
    AuthService->>TokenService: Generate reset token
    TokenService->>TokenService: Create signed, time-limited token
    TokenService->>EmailService: Send reset email with token
    EmailService->>User: Deliver reset email
    
    User->>Client: Click reset link with token
    Client->>AuthService: Validate reset token
    AuthService->>Client: Token validation result
    
    User->>Client: Enter new password
    Client->>AuthService: Submit new password with token
    AuthService->>AuthService: Validate password strength
    AuthService->>AuthService: Hash new password
    AuthService->>AuthService: Update password, invalidate sessions
    AuthService->>EmailService: Send confirmation email
    EmailService->>User: Password change notification
```

#### Password Reset Security Controls

| Control | Implementation | Security Benefit |
|---------|----------------|-----------------|
| Time-Limited Tokens | 15-minute expiration | Reduce exposure window |
| Single-Use Tokens | One-time use with invalidation | Prevent token reuse |
| Rate Limiting | Account-based limits | Prevent reset enumeration attacks |
| Notification | Email alerts for password changes | Early warning of unauthorized changes |
| Session Invalidation | Terminate all sessions on password change | Contain potential compromise |

    S1 & S2 & S3 --> A1 & A2 & A3
```

#### Profile Data Classification

| Data Category | Sensitivity | Protection Level | Example Fields |
|---------------|-------------|------------------|----------------|
| Public Profile | Low | Access controls | Name, profile picture, public bio |
| Contact Information | Medium | Field encryption | Email, phone, address |
| Identity Information | High | Field encryption, limited access | Date of birth, government ID numbers |
| Financial Information | Very High | Field encryption, tokenization | Payment methods, bank accounts |
| Verification Documents | Very High | Encrypted storage, expiration | ID scans, certification documents |

#### Encryption Strategy for Profile Data

| Data Type | Encryption Approach | Key Management | Access Pattern |
|-----------|---------------------|---------------|----------------|
| Basic PII | Application-level field encryption | Service-managed keys | Decrypted only when needed |
| Sensitive PII | Envelope encryption | CMK with rotating data keys | Strict access control |
| Financial Data | Tokenization + encryption | Payment processor managed | Token-only operations where possible |
| Documents | Encrypted at rest | User-specific derived keys | Temporary decryption for verification |

    UT1 & UT2 & UT3 & UT4 & UT5 --> AM1 & AM2 & AM3
    AM1 & AM2 & AM3 --> PF1 & PF2 & PF3
```

#### User Type Security Model

| User Type | Default Access Level | Verification Requirements | Security Constraints |
|-----------|---------------------|--------------------------|---------------------|
| Homeowner | Basic project creation | Email verification | Limited contractor data access |
| Contractor | Bid submission, profile management | Email, phone, license verification | Project data isolation |

#### Permission Enforcement Architecture

1. **Role Definitions**
   - Standard roles with predefined permission sets
   - Role inheritance hierarchy
   - Role composition for complex access patterns

2. **Resource Access Controls**
   - Resource ownership model
   - Explicit sharing with permission levels
   - Domain boundary enforcement

3. **Operation Authorization**
   - Operation-specific permission checks
   - Context-sensitive authorization
   - Temporal and state-based permissions

4. **Administrative Access**
   - Fine-grained admin permissions
   - Administrative action logging
   - Just-in-time privilege elevation

## Authorization Framework

### RBAC Implementation

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Role Hierarchy"
        RH1[Global Roles]
        RH2[Domain Roles]
        RH3[Resource Roles]
        RH4[Custom Roles]

    subgraph "Permission Sets"
        PS1[Resource Permissions]
        PS2[Action Permissions]
        PS3[Data Permissions]

    end
    
    RH1 & RH2 & RH3 & RH4 --> PS1 & PS2 & PS3
    PS1 & PS2 & PS3 --> AF1 --> AF2 --> AF3 --> AF4
```

#### Role Definitions

| Role Category | Examples | Inheritance | Assignment Process |
|---------------|----------|------------|-------------------|
| Global Roles | User, Admin, Guest | None | System-assigned at registration |
| Domain Roles | ProjectOwner, Bidder, Helper | Global roles | Context-specific assignment |
| Resource Roles | DocumentEditor, TeamMember | Domain roles | Resource-level assignment |
| Custom Roles | ProjectManager, QualityInspector | Various | Dynamic composition of permissions |

#### Permission Model

| Permission Type | Structure | Evaluation | Example |
|-----------------|-----------|------------|---------|
| Resource Permission | `resource:action` | Direct mapping | `project:read` |
| Action Permission | `domain:action:context` | Context-based | `bid:submit:public` |
| Data Permission | `data:field:operation` | Field-level | `user:contact:read` |

#### Authorization Implementation

```typescript
// Example: Role-based permission check middleware
const checkPermission = (
  requiredPermission: string,
  contextExtractor?: (req: Request) => string
) => {
  return async (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
    try {
      // Get authenticated user
      const user = req.user;
      if (!user) {
        return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Authentication required' });
      }
      
      // Get user's roles
      const roles = await getRolesForUser(user.id);
      
      // Get permissions for all roles
      const permissions = await getPermissionsForRoles(roles);
      
      // Check for specific permission
      const hasPermission = permissions.some(permission => {
        // For context-sensitive permissions
        if (contextExtractor && permission.includes('${context}')) {
          const context = contextExtractor(req);
          return permission.replace('${context}', context) === requiredPermission;
        }
        
        // Direct permission match
        return permission === requiredPermission || permission === '*';
      });
      
      if (!hasPermission) {
        return res.status(403).json({ error: 'Permission denied' });
      }
      
      // User has permission, proceed to handler
      next();
    } catch (error) {
      next(error);
    }
  };
};

// Example: Fine-grained field-level authorization
const authorizeResponseFields = (
  user: User,
  resource: any,
  resourceType: string
): any => {
  // Get user's permissions for this resource type
  const permissions = getUserPermissionsForResource(user, resourceType);
  
  // Start with empty authorized result
  const authorizedResult = {};
  
  // Process each field based on permissions
  Object.keys(resource).forEach(field => {
    const fieldPermission = `${resourceType}:${field}:read`;
    
    // Field is authorized if user has permission
    if (permissions.includes(fieldPermission) || permissions.includes(`${resourceType}:*:read`)) {
      authorizedResult[field] = resource[field];
    }
  });
  
  return authorizedResult;
};
```

### Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)

For more complex authorization scenarios, the system implements ABAC extensions to the RBAC model:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Policy Decision Point"
        PDP1[Policy Evaluation]
        PDP2[Attribute Resolution]
        PDP3[Context Enrichment]
    end
    
    subgraph "Policy Information Point"
        PIP1[User Attributes]
        PIP2[Resource Attributes]
        PIP3[Environmental Attributes]
    end
    
    subgraph "Policy Enforcement Point"
        PEP1[API Gateway]
        PEP2[Service Layer]
        PEP3[Data Access Layer]
    end
    
    PIP1 & PIP2 & PIP3 --> PDP1 & PDP2 & PDP3
    PDP1 & PDP2 & PDP3 --> PEP1 & PEP2 & PEP3
```

#### ABAC Implementation

```typescript
// Example: Policy evaluation with attributes
interface PolicyContext {
  user: {
    id: string;
    roles: string[];
    verificationLevel: string;
    attributes: Record<string, any>;
  };
  resource: {
    type: string;
    id: string;
    ownerId: string;
    status: string;
    attributes: Record<string, any>;
  };
  environment: {
    timestamp: Date;
    clientIp: string;
    location: string;
    riskScore: number;
  };
  action: {
    type: string;
    target: string;
    parameters: Record<string, any>;
  };
}

// Policy definition
interface Policy {
  id: string;
  effect: 'allow' | 'deny';
  condition: (context: PolicyContext) => boolean;
}

// Example policy: Contractors can only submit bids for open projects
const contractorBidPolicy: Policy = {
  id: 'contractor-bid-submission',
  effect: 'allow',
  condition: (ctx: PolicyContext): boolean => {
    // Check if user is a contractor
    const isContractor = ctx.user.roles.includes('contractor');
    
    // Check if resource is a project
    const isProject = ctx.resource.type === 'project';
    
    // Check if action is submitting a bid
    const isSubmitBid = ctx.action.type === 'submit' && ctx.action.target === 'bid';
    
    // Check if project is open for bids
    const isProjectOpen = ctx.resource.status === 'open';
    
    // Allow if all conditions are met
    return isContractor && isProject && isSubmitBid && isProjectOpen;
  }
};

// Policy evaluation engine
const evaluatePolicy = (
  policies: Policy[],
  context: PolicyContext
): boolean => {
  // Check for explicit deny policies first (deny overrides)
  const denyPolicies = policies.filter(p => p.effect === 'deny');
  for (const policy of denyPolicies) {
    if (policy.condition(context)) {
      return false; // Denied by policy
    }
  }
  
  // Then check for any allow policy
  const allowPolicies = policies.filter(p => p.effect === 'allow');
  for (const policy of allowPolicies) {
    if (policy.condition(context)) {
      return true; // Allowed by policy
    }
  }
  
  // Default to deny if no policy explicitly allows
  return false;
};
```

#### Privilege Assignment and Delegation

| Privilege Type | Assignment Method | Delegation Capability | Revocation Impact |
|----------------|-------------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| Basic User Rights | Automatic at registration | None | Account suspension |
| Role-Based Privileges | Administrative assignment | Limited delegation | Role removal |
| Resource Ownership | Creation or transfer | Granular permission sharing | Access removal, content preservation |
| Administrative Access | Formal assignment process | Temporary delegation for specific tasks | Complete access removal |

#### Administrative Access Controls

1. **Just-in-Time Privilege Elevation**
   - Time-limited administrative access
   - Purpose-specific approval workflow
   - Enhanced logging during elevated access

2. **Segregation of Administrative Duties**
   - Separate user management from system configuration
   - Divided access to financial and operational controls
   - Tiered approval workflows for critical changes

3. **Administrative Audit Trail**
   - Immutable logs of all administrative actions
   - Regular review of administrative activities
   - Anomaly detection for unusual administrative patterns

#### Data Protection Implementation

| Data Category | Protection Methods | Storage | Retention Policy | Access Controls |
|---------------|-------------------|---------|-----------------|----------------|
| Public Data | TLS in transit | Standard database | Platform lifetime | Public or authenticated, caching allowed |
| Internal Data | TLS, database encryption | Standard database | Platform lifetime | Authenticated, role-based, no caching |
| Sensitive Data | TLS, field encryption | Encrypted fields | According to legal requirements | Need-to-know basis, audit logged |
| Restricted Data | TLS, field encryption | Encrypted fields, secure storage | Minimum necessary | Strictly limited access, workflow approvals |
| Critical Data | TLS, field encryption, tokenization | Secure encrypted storage | Minimum necessary | System-only access, no direct user access |
