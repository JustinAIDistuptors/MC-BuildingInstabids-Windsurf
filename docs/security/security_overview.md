# InstaBids Security Architecture

This document outlines the comprehensive security architecture for the InstaBids platform. It covers authentication, authorization, data protection, API security, infrastructure security, compliance, and incident response procedures.

## Security Architecture Overview

The InstaBids security architecture follows a defense-in-depth approach, implementing multiple layers of security controls to protect user data, system integrity, and service availability:

## Authentication & Authorization

### Authentication System

InstaBids utilizes a multi-factor authentication system powered by Supabase Auth:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Frontend
    participant Auth Service
    participant API Gateway
    participant Backend Services
    
    User->>Frontend: Submit Credentials
    Frontend->>Auth Service: Authentication Request
    Auth Service->>Auth Service: Validate Credentials
    
    alt Invalid Credentials
        Auth Service->>Frontend: Authentication Failed
        Frontend->>User: Show Error Message
    else Valid Credentials
        Auth Service->>Auth Service: Generate JWT Tokens
        Auth Service->>Frontend: Return Access & Refresh Tokens
        Frontend->>Frontend: Store Tokens Securely
        
        Note over Frontend,Backend Services: For Subsequent API Calls
        Frontend->>API Gateway: API Request with Access Token
        API Gateway->>API Gateway: Validate Token
        API Gateway->>Backend Services: Forward Request with Claims
        Backend Services->>Backend Services: Check Permissions
        Backend Services->>API Gateway: Response
        API Gateway->>Frontend: Response
    end
```

#### Authentication Methods

1. **Email/Password Authentication**
   - Password complexity requirements: minimum 10 characters, requiring uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
   - Password hash: bcrypt with work factor 12
   - Secure password reset workflow with time-limited tokens

2. **Social Authentication**
   - Google
   - Apple
   - Facebook

3. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
   - SMS verification codes
   - Authenticator app support (TOTP)
   - Recovery codes for backup access
   - Required for high-privilege accounts and high-risk operations

4. **Token Management**
   - JWT-based authentication
   - Short-lived access tokens (1 hour)
   - Longer-lived refresh tokens (30 days) with rotation and automatic invalidation
   - Token revocation on logout or security concerns

### Authorization Model

InstaBids implements a comprehensive authorization model combining:

1. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
   - Core system roles: Admin, Support, Analyst
   - Domain-specific roles: Homeowner, Contractor, Helper, Property Manager

2. **Permission-Based Access Control (PBAC)**
   - Granular permissions mapped to API operations
   - Permission inheritance through roles
   - Custom permission sets for special cases

3. **Resource-Based Access Control**
   - Row-Level Security (RLS) policies in PostgreSQL
   - Object ownership and sharing rules
   - Resource visibility rules based on business relationships

#### Authorization Process

    B -->|Yes| D{Has Role?}
    D -->|No| E[Return 403 Forbidden]
    D -->|Yes| F{Has Permission?}
    F -->|No| G[Return 403 Forbidden]
    F -->|Yes| H{Has Resource Access?}
    H -->|No| I[Return 403 Forbidden]
    H -->|Yes| J[Process Request]

    style I fill:#f88,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
    style J fill:#8f8,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
```

#### Authentication & Authorization Implementation

The system implements authentication and authorization through:

1. **Supabase Auth** for authentication services
2. **API Gateway middleware** for token validation and basic authorization
3. **Backend service middleware** for fine-grained authorization
4. **Database RLS policies** for data access control
5. **Frontend route guards** for UI access control

## Data Protection

### Data Classification

InstaBids classifies data into four categories with corresponding security controls:

| Classification | Description | Examples | Security Controls |
|---------------|-------------|----------|------------------|
| Public | Information publicly available with no restrictions | Marketing materials, public listings | Basic integrity controls |
| Internal | Information for internal use, limited business impact if disclosed | Internal documentation, non-sensitive configurations | Access controls, basic encryption |
| Confidential | Business-sensitive information, moderate impact if disclosed | Project details, bid information, user profiles | Strong access controls, encryption in transit and at rest, audit logging |
| Restricted | Highly sensitive information, severe impact if disclosed | Payment information, SSNs, ID documents | Strong encryption, strict access controls, MFA, enhanced monitoring |

### Encryption Strategy
