| Team Dissolution | Archive team data, revoke all access | Log dissolution details and final state |

## Authorization & Access Control

### Role-Based Access Control

The Group Bidding domain implements a fine-grained RBAC model with the following roles:

| Role | Description | Permissions | Assignment Process |
|------|-------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Team Lead | Primary team organizer | Full team management, bid submission, payment distribution | Self-assigned at team creation or delegated |
| Component Owner | Responsible for specific bid components | Component editing, dependent component viewing | Assigned by team lead or self-selected |
| Financial Manager | Handles payment distribution | Payment plan creation, escrow management | Assigned by team lead |
| Team Member | Standard team participant | Component viewing, decision voting | Default role when joining team |
| Observer | Limited visibility participant | View-only access to specific components | Explicitly assigned by team lead |

### Access Control Enforcement

Access control is enforced at multiple levels:

1. **API Layer**
   - JWT-based authorization with team and role claims
   - Request validation against permission matrix
   - Field-level redaction based on permission model

2. **Service Layer**
   - Team membership verification before processing
   - Component ownership validation for edits
   - Context-specific permission evaluation

3. **Database Layer**
   - Row-level security policies in PostgreSQL
   - Team-based data isolation
   - Attribute-based access control for sensitive fields

4. **Client Applications**
   - UI rendering based on permission model
   - Client-side enforcement as defense in depth
   - Secure local storage with permission filtering

### Cross-Team Isolation

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Data Isolation"
        DI1[Team Boundary Enforcement]
        DI2[Cross-Team Query Prevention]
        DI3[Logical Data Separation]
    end
    
    subgraph "API Isolation"
        AI1[Team Context Validation]
        AI2[Team Parameter Binding]

    subgraph "UI Isolation"
        UI1[Team Workspace Separation]
        UI2[UI Permission Filtering]
        UI3[Team Switching Context]
    end
```

Cross-team isolation is enforced through:

1. **Database Schema Design**
   - Team ID as foreign key in all team-related tables
   - Database constraints enforcing team boundaries
   - Parameterized queries with team context

2. **Service Implementation**
   - Team membership validation on all operations
   - Context propagation across service boundaries
   - Team ID included in all cross-service calls

3. **API Gateway Controls**
   - Team context extraction from authentication token
   - Request enrichment with verified team information
   - Response filtering based on team membership

   - Immutable decision records

## Security Implementation Patterns

### Authentication Implementation

```typescript
// Example: Team authentication context extension
interface TeamAuthContext extends AuthContext {
  teamIds: string[];
  teamRoles: Record<string, TeamRole>;
  componentOwnership: Record<string, string[]>;
  canSubmitBid: boolean;
  canManageTeam: boolean;
}

// Example: Team-aware authentication middleware
const teamAuthMiddleware = (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
  const authContext = req.auth as TeamAuthContext;
  const teamId = req.params.teamId || req.body.teamId;
  
  // Verify team membership
  if (!teamId || !authContext.teamIds.includes(teamId)) {
    return res.status(403).send({ error: 'Team access denied' });
  }
  
  // Enrich request with team-specific context
  req.teamContext = {
    teamId,
    role: authContext.teamRoles[teamId] || 'member',
    ownedComponents: authContext.componentOwnership[teamId] || [],
    permissions: getTeamPermissions(authContext.teamRoles[teamId])
  };
  
  next();
};
```

### Authorization Implementation

```typescript
// Example: Permission verification for component operations
const verifyComponentPermission = (
  operation: 'view' | 'edit' | 'delete',
  component: Component,
  teamContext: TeamContext
): boolean => {
  // Team lead can do anything
  if (teamContext.role === 'lead') {
    return true;
  }
  
  // Component owners can edit their own components
  if (operation === 'edit' && component.ownerId === teamContext.userId) {
    return true;
  }
  
  // Financial manager can view but not edit
  if (operation === 'view' && teamContext.role === 'financial') {
    return true;
  }
  
  // Team members can view all components
  if (operation === 'view' && teamContext.role === 'member') {
    return true;
  }
  
  // Dependent component owners can view dependencies
  if (operation === 'view' && component.dependencyIds.some(id => 
    teamContext.ownedComponents.includes(id))) {
    return true;
  }
  
  return false;
};

// Example: Database query with team isolation
const getTeamComponents = async (teamId: string, userId: string): Promise<Component[]> => {
  // Using query parameters to enforce team isolation
  const result = await db.query(
    `SELECT 
      c.*,
      CASE WHEN c.owner_id = $2 THEN true ELSE false END as is_owner,
      CASE WHEN c.sensitivity > 1 AND c.owner_id != $2 
           THEN mask_sensitive_fields(c) 
           ELSE c END as content
     FROM components c
     WHERE c.team_id = $1
     ORDER BY c.created_at DESC`,
    [teamId, userId]
  );
  
  return result.rows;
};
```

### Data Protection Implementation

```typescript
// Example: Field-level encryption for sensitive component data
const encryptComponentFields = (
  component: Component,
  teamKey: Buffer
): EncryptedComponent => {
  // Fields that need encryption
  const sensitiveFields = ['pricingStrategy', 'proprietaryTechnique', 'supplierDetails'];
  
  const encryptedComponent = { ...component };
  
  // Only encrypt sensitive fields
  for (const field of sensitiveFields) {
    if (component[field]) {
      encryptedComponent[field] = encrypt(component[field], teamKey);
    }
  }
  
  return encryptedComponent;
};

// Example: Secure component storage with team isolation
const storeComponent = async (
  component: Component,
  teamId: string,
  userId: string
): Promise<void> => {
  // Get team encryption key
  const teamKey = await getTeamEncryptionKey(teamId);
  
  // Encrypt sensitive fields
  const encryptedComponent = encryptComponentFields(component, teamKey);
  
  // Store with team isolation
  await db.query(
    `INSERT INTO components(
      id, team_id, owner_id, title, description, 
      pricing_strategy, proprietary_technique, supplier_details,
      estimated_cost, created_at, updated_at
    ) VALUES($1, $2, $3, $4, $5, $6, $7, $8, $9, $10, $11)`,
    [
      component.id, teamId, userId, component.title, component.description,
      encryptedComponent.pricingStrategy, encryptedComponent.proprietaryTechnique,
      encryptedComponent.supplierDetails, component.estimatedCost,
      new Date(), new Date()
    ]
  );
};
```

```

## Security Compliance & Standards

### Regulatory Considerations

| Regulation | Relevance | Key Requirements | Implementation |
|------------|-----------|------------------|----------------|
| GDPR | Medium | Personal data protection, right to be forgotten | Team member data minimization, deletion workflows |
| CCPA | Medium | Disclosure of data sharing, opt-out rights | Transparent team data policies, data sharing controls |
| PCI DSS | High (for payment) | Secure payment handling, tokenization | Payment data isolation, PCI-compliant processing |
| NIST 800-53 | Reference | Security controls framework | Defense-in-depth, principle of least privilege |
| ISO 27001 | Reference | Information security management | Risk assessment, security controls, continual improvement |

### Security Best Practices

1. **Least Privilege Principle**
   - Default to Team Member role with minimal permissions
   - Permission elevation requires explicit team lead approval
   - Regular permission audits and pruning

2. **Defense in Depth**
   - Multi-layer security controls (API, service, database)
   - Independent verification mechanisms
   - Redundant security boundaries

3. **Zero Trust Architecture**
   - Continuous authentication and authorization
   - Network-independent security model
   - Explicit verification for all operations

#### Mobile Implementation

1. **Secure Storage**
   - Encrypted SQLite database using SQLCipher
   - Secure key storage using Keychain/Keystore
   - Automatic data purging based on sensitivity

2. **Secure Sync**
   - Authenticated sync protocol
   - Change verification and validation
   - Conflict resolution with security validation

3. **Offline Controls**
   - Time-limited offline access
   - Permission enforcement in offline mode
   - Remote management capabilities

### Cross-Device Security

| Scenario | Security Challenge | Implementation | User Experience |
|----------|-------------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Device Switching | Session continuity, data consistency | Secure session transfer, sync verification | Seamless transition between devices |
| Multiple Device Use | Concurrent access, sync conflicts | Real-time conflict detection, version vectors | Consistent view across devices |
| Device Loss | Data exposure, unauthorized access | Remote wipe, automatic session expiration | Minimal disruption to team |
| New Device Addition | Authentication, data bootstrapping | Trusted device verification, progressive sync | Quick onboarding process |
