# Data Migration & Versioning Strategy

This document outlines the comprehensive strategy for data migration and schema evolution for the InstaBids platform. As the system evolves through its development phases, a robust approach to managing schema changes, data transitions, and version compatibility is essential for maintaining system integrity and ensuring smooth upgrades.

## Data Migration Philosophy

The InstaBids data migration strategy is guided by the following principles:

1. **Zero-Downtime Migrations**: Minimize or eliminate service interruptions during migrations
2. **Data Integrity Preservation**: Ensure data consistency and prevent loss during schema changes
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain support for existing clients during transition periods
4. **Progressive Implementation**: Apply changes incrementally rather than in large, risky batches
5. **Automated Verification**: Validate data integrity before, during, and after migrations
6. **Rollback Capability**: Support reversing migrations if issues are encountered

## Schema Evolution Approach

### Schema Versioning

InstaBids will implement explicit schema versioning to track database changes:

1. **Database Level Versioning**
   - Major version: Significant structural changes requiring full migration
   - Minor version: Compatible schema additions or non-breaking modifications
   - Patch version: Bug fixes and minimal schema adjustments

2. **Table Level Versioning**
   - Tables requiring compatibility across versions will include version columns
   - Temporal tables for tracking historical schema states
   - Version metadata stored in dedicated versioning tables

3. **API-Schema Alignment**
   - API versions directly mapped to compatible schema versions
   - Client requests tagged with API version to determine schema interaction

### Schema Change Categories

| Change Type | Description | Migration Complexity | Backward Compatibility |
|-------------|-------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| Additive | Adding new tables or columns | Low | High |
| Renaming | Changing table or column names | Medium | Medium (via views) |
| Structural | Changing relationships or constraints | High | Medium |
| Data Type | Altering column types | Medium-High | Varies by change |
| Removal | Dropping tables or columns | Low | Low |

### Schema Evolution Patterns

1. **Expand and Contract Pattern**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant App as Application
    participant DB as Database
    
    Note over App,DB: Phase 1: Expansion
    App->>DB: Add new column/table
    App->>DB: Deploy code to write to both old and new
    App->>DB: Begin reading from new, fallback to old
    
    Note over App,DB: Phase 2: Migration
    App->>DB: Migrate existing data to new structure
    App->>DB: Validate data consistency
    
    Note over App,DB: Phase 3: Contraction
    App->>DB: Update code to only use new structure
    App->>DB: Mark old structure as deprecated
    App->>DB: Eventually remove old structure
```

2. **Blue-Green Schema Migration**

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Current Schema - "Blue"] --> B[Application with Dual Support]
    C[New Schema - "Green"] --> B
    B --> D{Migration Complete?}
    D -->|No| B
    D -->|Yes| E[Application with New Schema Only]
    E --> F[Decommission Old Schema]
    
    classDef current fill:#bbf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px;
    classDef new fill:#bfb,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px;
    classDef app fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px;
    
    class A current;
    class C,F new;
    class B,E app;
```

3. **Feature Flags for Schema Changes**

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Code Deployment with Feature Flag] --> B{Feature Flag On?}
    B -->|Yes| C[Use New Schema]
    B -->|No| D[Use Old Schema]
    C --> E[Incremental Rollout]
    E --> F[Complete Rollout]
    F --> G[Remove Feature Flag]
    G --> H[Clean Up Old Schema]
    
    classDef flag fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px;
    classDef schema fill:#bbf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px;
    
    class A,B,E,F,G flag;
    class C,D,H schema;
```

## Schema Version Control

### Database Change Management

1. **Migration Script Standards**
   - Descriptive, timestamp-based naming convention
   - Transactional implementation where possible
   - Clear documentation of purpose and impact
   - Corresponding rollback scripts

   Example naming convention:
   ```
   V20250401_1432__add_contractor_verification_levels.sql
   R20250401_1432__rollback_contractor_verification_levels.sql
   ```

2. **Change Script Categories**
   - Structural scripts (DDL changes)
   - Data migration scripts (data transformation)
   - Reference data scripts (lookup data updates)
   - Constraint and index management
   - Permissions and security updates

3. **Migration Metadata**
   - Version tracking table with applied migrations
   - Execution timestamp and duration
   - Executing user and environment
   - Checksum validation for script integrity

### Version Compatibility Matrix

The system will maintain a compatibility matrix to ensure proper client-server interaction:

| Client Version | Backend v1.0 | Backend v1.1 | Backend v2.0 | Backend v2.1 |
|----------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| App v1.0 | Full | Full | Partial | Partial |
| App v1.1 | Full | Full | Partial | Partial |
| App v2.0 | No | No | Full | Full |
| App v2.1 | No | No | Full | Full |

### API Versioning Strategy

1. **URL Path Versioning**
   - Major version in URL: `/api/v1/projects`
   - Ensures clear distinction between incompatible versions

2. **Header-Based Versioning for Minor Changes**
   - Accept-Version header for minor/patch versions
   - Maintains URL stability for compatible changes

3. **Deprecation Process**
   - Explicit deprecation notices in responses
   - Grace period before removing deprecated endpoints
   - Documentation of migration paths for clients

## Data Migration Scenarios

### Complex Migration Examples

#### Example 1: Bidding Model Evolution

**Current State**:
- Simple bid structure with total amount
- Limited customization options

**Target State**:
- Line-item based bidding
- Multiple pricing models
- Detailed material and labor breakdown

**Migration Strategy**:
1. Add new bid structure tables alongside existing
2. Create bidirectional sync mechanism during transition
3. Develop data transformation for existing bids to new format
4. Update API to support both formats with version detection
5. Gradually transition clients to new format
6. Deprecate old structure after adoption threshold reached

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Add New Bid Structure] --> B[Sync Mechanism]
    B --> C[Data Transformation]
    C --> D[Dual API Support]
    D --> E[Client Transition]
    E --> F[Old Structure Deprecation]
    
    G[Simple Bid Table] --> H{Fork}
    H --> I[Continue Using Simple]
    H --> J[Transform to Line Item]
    I --> K[API v1 - Simple]
    J --> L[API v2 - Line Item]
    K --> M[Eventual Deprecation]
    L --> N[Full Adoption]
    
    classDef current fill:#bbf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px;
    classDef new fill:#bfb,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px;
    classDef deprecated fill:#fbb,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px;
    
    class G,I,K current;
    class J,L,N new;
    class M deprecated;
```

#### Example 2: User Profile Enhancement

**Current State**:
- Basic profile with limited contractor information
- Single table structure for all user types

**Target State**:
- Rich profiles with type-specific attributes
- Separate tables for different user specializations
- Enhanced verification and credential storage

**Migration Strategy**:
1. Create new specialized profile tables
2. Add linking identifiers to existing profile table
3. Incrementally migrate users based on activity
4. Update user authentication flow to check multiple profile sources
5. Consolidate to new structure once migration complete

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Core as Core User Table
    participant App as Application
    participant Type as Type-Specific Tables
    
    Note over Core,Type: Initial State
    App->>Core: Read all user data
    
    Note over Core,Type: Transition State
    App->>Core: Read basic user data
    Core-->>App: Return core data
    App->>Type: Check for specialized data
    Type-->>App: Return if available
    
    Note over Core,Type: Progressive Migration
    App->>Core: Update profile
    App->>Type: Create/update specialized data
    
    Note over Core,Type: Final State
    App->>Type: Read complete user data
    Type->>Core: Reference for auth only
```
