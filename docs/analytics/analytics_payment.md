   - High-risk entity monitoring

2. **Compliance Reporting**
   - Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) tracking
   - Currency Transaction Report (CTR) generation
   - Cross-border transaction reporting
   - Regulatory threshold monitoring

3. **Audit Support**
   - Detailed transaction audit trails
   - Compliance action logging
   - Documentation completeness metrics
   - Response time to regulatory requests

### 2. Geographic Monitoring

Analytics for monitoring payment activity by geographic region and ensuring regional compliance:

        Input[Transaction Location Data]
        RegionalAnalysis[Regional Activity Analysis]
        ComplianceRules[Regional Compliance Rules]
        Output[Geographic Compliance Insights]
        
        Input --> RegionalAnalysis --> ComplianceRules --> Output
        
        Output --> A[Regional Risk Flagging]
        Output --> B[Jurisdiction-Specific Reporting]
        Output --> C[Cross-Border Flow Monitoring]
        Output --> D[Sanction Screening]
    end
```

**Monitoring Capabilities:**

1. **Regional Activity Monitoring**
   - Transaction volume by region
   - Unusual regional pattern detection
   - Cross-border transaction flows
   - Sanctioned country screening

2. **Jurisdiction-Specific Compliance**
   - Region-specific reporting thresholds
   - Local regulatory requirement tracking
   - Regional privacy compliance
   - Tax reporting by jurisdiction

        end
    end
```

**Key Metrics:**

1. **Access Control Effectiveness**
   - Permission-appropriate access rates
   - Permission exception tracking
   - Role-based access pattern compliance
   - Temporary access monitoring

2. **Data Protection Coverage**
   - Encryption coverage by data category
   - Tokenization implementation rate
   - Field-level protection effectiveness
   - Data masking consistency

## Implementation Patterns

### 1. Real-time Analytics Implementation

```typescript
// Example: Real-time payment analytics event processing
class PaymentAnalyticsProcessor {
  // Process payment event for real-time analytics
  async processPaymentEvent(event: PaymentEvent): Promise<void> {
    try {
      // Transform event into analytics format
      const analyticsEvent = this.transformToAnalyticsFormat(event);
      
      // Update real-time metrics
      await this.updateRealTimeMetrics(analyticsEvent);
      
      // Store event in time-series database for real-time queries
      await this.timeSeriesDB.storeEvent(analyticsEvent);
      
      // Publish to real-time dashboard topic
      await this.publishToDashboard(analyticsEvent);
      
      // Check for anomalies or alert conditions
      await this.anomalyDetection.checkEvent(analyticsEvent);
      
      // Queue for batch processing
      await this.batchProcessingQueue.enqueue(analyticsEvent);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error processing payment analytics event', error);
      await this.errorTracking.logError(error, { eventType: event.type });
    }
  }
  
  // Update real-time metrics in cache
  private async updateRealTimeMetrics(event: PaymentAnalyticsEvent): Promise<void> {
    const keys = this.getMetricKeys(event);
    
    // Update transaction count metrics
    await this.metricsCache.increment(`${keys.base}.count`, 1);
    
    // Update status-specific counts
    await this.metricsCache.increment(`${keys.base}.status.${event.status}`, 1);
    
    // Update amount metrics if applicable
    if (event.amount) {
      await this.metricsCache.add(`${keys.base}.amount.total`, event.amount);
      await this.metricsCache.updateAvg(`${keys.base}.amount.avg`, event.amount);
    }
    
    // Update duration metrics if applicable
    if (event.durationMs) {
      await this.metricsCache.updateAvg(`${keys.base}.duration.avg`, event.durationMs);
      await this.metricsCache.updatePercentile(`${keys.base}.duration.p95`, event.durationMs, 95);
    }
    
    // Update success rate metrics
    const total = await this.metricsCache.get(`${keys.base}.count`);
    const success = await this.metricsCache.get(`${keys.base}.status.success`);
    if (total > 0) {
      const successRate = (success / total) * 100;
      await this.metricsCache.set(`${keys.base}.rate.success`, successRate);
    }
  }
  
  // Generate metric keys
