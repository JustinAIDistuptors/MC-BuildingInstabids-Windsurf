# Domain Agent Prompt Template

This template defines the standard structure for domain-specific agent prompts in the Domain-Driven Agent Architecture (DDAA). Each domain agent is responsible for implementing a complete vertical slice of functionality following the sandwich architecture pattern.

## Template Structure

## IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH

### Runtime LLM-Enhanced Sandwich Architecture Pattern

Always implement features following the three-layer Runtime LLM-Enhanced Sandwich pattern:

1. **Guard Layer (Top Bread)** - *Conventional TypeScript/JavaScript Code*
   - Input validation and sanitization
   - Permission checking and authorization
   - Request format validation
   - Error handling and standardized responses

2. **Domain Logic Layer (Filling)** - *Conventional Code with LLM Consultation*
   - Implement core business rules in TypeScript/JavaScript
   - Include `useLLM()` method calls for complex decisions
   - Provide appropriate context when consulting the LLM
   - Process and apply LLM recommendations in your code
   - Orchestrate workflow between components
   - Manage state transitions and event generation

3. **Persistence Layer (Bottom Bread)** - *Conventional TypeScript/JavaScript Code*
   - Data access operations
   - Transaction management
   - Data mapping and transformation
   - Query optimization

### Documentation Reference Guide

When implementing each layer, consult the relevant documentation:

#### Persistence Layer (Bottom Bread)
- Database Schema: See `docs/schema/schema_[domain].sql`
- ERD Diagrams: See `docs/erd/erd_[domain].md`
- Data access patterns: See `docs/adr/adr_03_database_access_pattern.md`

#### Domain Logic Layer (Filling)
- Business Processes: See `docs/flow/flow_[specific_process].md`
- Service Interfaces: See `docs/interfaces/interfaces_[domain].ts`
- Event-Driven Communication: See `docs/adr/adr_04_event_driven_communication.md`

#### Guard Layer (Top Bread)
- API Specifications: See `docs/api/api_[domain].yaml`
- Security Requirements: See `docs/security/security_[domain].md`
- Authentication Strategy: See `docs/adr/adr_02_authentication_strategy.md`

### Integration Implementation

For cross-domain integration points:
- Review integration map: `docs/integration/integration_[domain].md`
- Implement event-based communication when appropriate
- Use well-defined contracts for direct service calls
- Maintain unidirectional dependencies

## IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS

Follow this process when implementing a new feature:

1. **Analyze Requirements**
   - Clearly understand what needs to be implemented
   - Identify which entities and relationships are involved
   - Determine the business rules that apply

2. **Start with Data Model**
   - Define or update database schema (bottom bread)
   - Implement data access operations
   - Test database operations

3. **Implement Domain Logic with LLM Consultation**
   - Build the domain logic layer (filling) in TypeScript/JavaScript
   - Identify decision points where LLM consultation is valuable
   - Implement `useLLM()` method calls with appropriate context
   - Process and apply LLM responses in your business logic

4. **Add Protection Layer**
   - Implement the guard layer (top bread)
   - Add validation, security, and error handling
   - Ensure proper API contract adherence

5. **Test Comprehensively**
   - Unit test each layer independently
   - Integration test the complete sandwich
   - Verify integration points with other domains

## QUALITY CHECKLIST

Before considering an implementation complete, verify:

- [ ] Database schema correctly implements entity relationships
- [ ] Persistence layer handles all required data operations
- [ ] Business logic implements all required domain rules
- [ ] Guard layer validates all inputs and ensures security
- [ ] Code follows architectural patterns consistently
- [ ] Integration points respect domain boundaries
- [ ] Tests cover both happy path and error scenarios
- [ ] Documentation is updated to reflect implementation

## COMMON PATTERNS

### Error Handling

```typescript
try {
  // Operation that might fail
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof DomainError) {
    // Handle domain-specific errors
  } else if (error instanceof ValidationError) {
    // Handle validation errors
  } else {
    // Handle unexpected errors
    logger.error('Unexpected error', { error, context });
    throw new SystemError('An unexpected error occurred', { cause: error });
  }
}
```

### Data Validation

```typescript
// In Guard Layer
const validateInput = (input: unknown): Input => {
  const result = inputSchema.safeParse(input);
  if (!result.success) {
    throw new ValidationError('Invalid input', result.error);
  }
  return result.data;
};
```

### Transaction Management

```typescript
// In Persistence Layer
const createWithTransaction = async (data: CreateData): Promise<Entity> => {
  return await db.transaction(async (trx) => {
    const entity = await trx.insert('entities', data).returning('*');
    await trx.insert('entity_history', { 
      entity_id: entity.id, 
      action: 'created',
      data
    });
    return entity;
  });
};
```

### Event Publishing

```typescript
// In Domain Layer
const completeAction = async (id: string): Promise<void> => {
  const entity = await entityRepository.findById(id);
  if (!entity) {
    throw new NotFoundError('Entity not found');
  }
  
  entity.status = 'completed';
  entity.completedAt = new Date();
  
  await entityRepository.update(entity);
  await eventBus.publish('entity.completed', { 
    entityId: entity.id,
    timestamp: entity.completedAt
  });
};
```
```
