# Domain-Driven Agent Architecture (DDAA)

Welcome to the Domain-Driven Agent Architecture (DDAA) framework, an innovative approach to building complex, multi-domain systems using specialized AI agents organized by domain boundaries.

## Overview

DDAA combines domain-driven design principles with AI-powered agents and a layered "sandwich" architecture to create robust, maintainable applications that can be developed at unprecedented speed while maintaining architectural integrity.

## Key Concepts

- **Domain Specialization**: Each business domain has a dedicated agent with specialized knowledge
- **Hierarchical Agent Organization**: Agents are organized in a tiered structure (Overlord, Master Chief, Domain Agents)
- **Sandwich Architecture**: Each domain implements a three-layer sandwich (Guard, Domain, Persistence)
- **Pattern-First Development**: Architectural patterns are defined and enforced before functionality
- **Intent-Driven Interfaces**: Business operations are expressed as high-level intents

## Documentation

This framework is documented in the following files:

1. [Architecture Overview](./architecture_overview.md) - Core concepts and structure of DDAA
2. [Pattern Catalog](./pattern_catalog.md) - Detailed descriptions of architectural patterns 
3. [Intent-Driven Development](./intent_driven_development.md) - Guide to building intent-driven interfaces
4. [InstaBids Implementation](./instabids_implementation.md) - Application of DDAA to the InstaBids platform

## InstaBids Application

InstaBids is a contractor bidding platform with multiple workspaces and complex features that will be implemented using the DDAA approach. Key domains include:

- User Management
- Project Management
- Bidding
- Messaging
- Payment
- AI Outreach
- Community

## Implementation Plan

The implementation will follow these high-level steps:

1. **Foundation Setup**: Establish the sandwich architecture framework
2. **Core Domains**: Implement User Management, Project Management, and Bidding domains
3. **Supporting Domains**: Add Messaging and Payment functionality
4. **Advanced Features**: Integrate AI Outreach and Community features

## Benefits

The DDAA approach offers significant benefits:

- **Development Speed**: Dramatically faster implementation through domain specialization
- **Architectural Integrity**: Consistent patterns enforced across the system
- **Reduced Technical Debt**: Architectural best practices from day one
- **Scalable Organization**: Aligns with how large projects are naturally organized
- **Enhanced Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns with defined interfaces

## Getting Started

To begin working with this architecture:

1. Review the [Architecture Overview](./architecture_overview.md) to understand the core concepts
2. Study the [Pattern Catalog](./pattern_catalog.md) to learn about the architectural patterns
3. Explore [Intent-Driven Development](./intent_driven_development.md) to see how interfaces are designed
4. Read the [InstaBids Implementation](./instabids_implementation.md) for a practical application

The DDAA approach represents a paradigm shift in how software is architected and built, with the potential to transform development speed and quality.
