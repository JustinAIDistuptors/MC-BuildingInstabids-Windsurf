# Intent-Driven Development in DDAA

Intent-Driven Development (IDD) is a core paradigm in the Domain-Driven Agent Architecture (DDAA). This approach abstracts the "how" from the "what," allowing developers to express their intentions at a higher level while leaving implementation details to the domain agents.

## Core Concepts

Intent-Driven Development is built around these key principles:

1. **Intent Expression**: Developers express what they want to accomplish rather than how to do it
2. **Domain Context**: Intents are understood within specific domain contexts
3. **Implementation Abstraction**: Technical details are hidden behind intent interfaces
4. **Pattern Enforcement**: Architectural patterns are enforced automatically
5. **Adaptive Implementation**: The same intent may be implemented differently based on context

## Traditional vs. Intent-Driven Approach

### Traditional Approach:

```typescript
// Direct database queries with implementation details exposed
const bids = await db.query(`
  SELECT b.*, u.name as contractor_name
  FROM bids b
  JOIN users u ON b.contractor_id = u.id
  WHERE b.project_id = ${projectId}
  AND b.status = 'active'
  ORDER BY b.created_at DESC
  LIMIT 20
`);

// Manual handling of cross-cutting concerns
if (!await checkPermission(currentUser, 'read', projectId)) {
  throw new Error('Unauthorized');
}

// Direct mutation with manual validation
await db.execute(`
  UPDATE bids
  SET status = 'accepted', accepted_at = NOW()
  WHERE id = ${bidId} AND project_id = ${projectId}
`);
```

### Intent-Driven Approach:

```typescript
// Express what you want, not how to get it
const bids = await biddingAgent.fulfillIntent('getActiveBidsForProject', {
  projectId,
  currentUser,
  options: { includeContractorDetails: true }
});

// Business operation rather than database operation
await biddingAgent.fulfillIntent('acceptBid', {
  bidId,
  currentUser
});
```

## Benefits of Intent-Driven Development

1. **Reduced Boilerplate**: Eliminates repetitive pattern-enforcing code
2. **Consistent Implementations**: The same intent is handled consistently
3. **Abstracted Complexity**: Complex validation and access control logic is hidden
4. **Future-Proofing**: Implementation can evolve without changing intent interfaces
5. **Better Testing**: Intents can be tested independently of implementation details

## Implementation in DDAA

Each domain agent in the DDAA framework provides intent-driven interfaces:

```typescript
class BiddingAgent {
  constructor(
    private guardLayer: DatabaseAgentProxy,
    private dataInterface: DataInterface,
    private currentUser: { id: string; role: string }
  ) {}
  
  async fulfillIntent(intent: string, params: any): Promise<any> {
    switch (intent) {
      case 'getActiveBidsForProject':
        return this.getActiveBidsForProject(params.projectId, params.options);
      
      case 'createBid':
        return this.createBid(params.projectId, params.bidData);
      
      case 'acceptBid':
        return this.acceptBid(params.bidId);
      
      default:
        throw new Error(`Unknown intent: ${intent}`);
    }
  }
  
  private async getActiveBidsForProject(projectId: string, options?: any): Promise<any[]> {
    // Guard layer enforces patterns (auth, domain boundaries, etc.)
    await this.guardLayer.enforcePatterns({
      operation: 'read',
      domain: 'bidding',
      resourceId: projectId,
      userId: this.currentUser.id
    });
    
    // Implementation details hidden from caller
    return this.dataInterface.query('bids', {
      where: { project_id: projectId, status: 'active' },
      include: options?.includeContractorDetails ? ['contractor'] : []
    });
  }
  
  // Other implementation methods...
}
```

## Advanced Implementation: Natural Language Intents

As the system evolves, intent interfaces can become more flexible, eventually supporting natural language:

```typescript
// Future evolution - natural language intents
const bids = await biddingAgent.fulfillIntent(
  'Find all active bids for my current project with contractor details',
  { projectId }
);
```

This requires more sophisticated intent parsing but maintains the same fundamental architecture.

## Intent Registry

Each domain maintains a registry of supported intents:

```typescript
// Example intent registry for Bidding domain
const BIDDING_INTENTS = {
  'getActiveBidsForProject': {
    description: 'Retrieves all active bids for a specific project',
    requiredParams: ['projectId'],
    optionalParams: ['options'],
    returns: 'Array of bid objects'
  },
  
  'createBid': {
    description: 'Creates a new bid for a project',
    requiredParams: ['projectId', 'bidData'],
    returns: 'The created bid object'
  },
  
  // More intent definitions...
};
```

This registry serves as documentation and can be used for validation and automation.

## Guidelines for Creating Intents

When designing intent interfaces:

1. **Use Domain Language**: Name intents using terms from the domain's ubiquitous language
2. **Be Specific**: Each intent should have a clear, specific purpose
3. **Avoid Technical Details**: Keep implementation details out of intent names and parameters
4. **Include Context**: Provide enough context for the intent to be properly fulfilled
5. **Consider Composability**: Design intents that can be composed for complex operations

Intent-Driven Development represents a paradigm shift in how software is created, moving from imperative "how" instructions to declarative "what" expressions that align more closely with business needs.
