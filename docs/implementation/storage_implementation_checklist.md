# Storage Implementation Checklist

This checklist tracks the status of the storage implementation across all domains in the InstaBids platform.

## Foundation Components

- [x] Shared storage constants (`src/shared/constants/storage.ts`)
- [x] Storage bucket reference document (`overwatch-memory/storage_bucket_reference.md`)
- [x] Domain agent prompt template update for storage (`docs/architecture/ddaa/domain_agent_prompt_template.md`)
- [x] Storage bucket creation script (`scripts/create-storage-buckets.js`)
- [x] Environment verification script (`scripts/verify-environment-setup.js`)
- [x] Project domain storage guide (`docs/storage/storage_project_domain.md`)
- [x] Project domain agent example (`docs/architecture/ddaa/project_agent_prompt_example.md`)

## Domain Implementations

### Project Domain
- [x] Project storage service (`src/domains/project/services/project-storage-service.ts`)
- [ ] Project storage unit tests
- [ ] Project storage integration tests

### User Domain
- [x] User storage service (`src/domains/user/services/user-storage-service.ts`)
- [x] User domain storage guide (`docs/storage/storage_user_domain.md`)
- [x] User domain agent example (`docs/architecture/ddaa/user_agent_prompt_example.md`)
- [ ] User storage unit tests
- [ ] User storage integration tests

### Bidding Domain
- [x] Bidding storage service (`src/domains/bidding/services/bidding-storage-service.ts`)
- [x] Bidding domain storage guide (`docs/storage/storage_bidding_domain.md`)
- [ ] Bidding domain agent example (`docs/architecture/ddaa/bidding_agent_prompt_example.md`) 
- [ ] Bidding storage unit tests
- [ ] Bidding storage integration tests

### Messaging Domain
- [x] Messaging storage service (`src/domains/messaging/services/messaging-storage-service.ts`)
- [x] Messaging domain storage guide (`docs/storage/storage_messaging_domain.md`)
- [ ] Messaging domain agent example (`docs/architecture/ddaa/messaging_agent_prompt_example.md`)
- [ ] Messaging storage unit tests
- [ ] Messaging storage integration tests

### Payment Domain
- [x] Payment storage service (`src/domains/payment/services/payment-storage-service.ts`)
- [x] Payment domain storage guide (`docs/storage/storage_payment_domain.md`)
- [ ] Payment domain agent example (`docs/architecture/ddaa/payment_agent_prompt_example.md`)
- [ ] Payment storage unit tests
- [ ] Payment storage integration tests

## Bucket Creation and Management

- [x] Bucket creation script (`scripts/create-storage-buckets.js`)
- [x] No-RLS implementation guide (`docs/implementation/storage_implementation_guide_no_rls.md`)
- [ ] Migration scripts for bucket changes

## Cross-Domain Integration

- [ ] Intent-based storage access examples
- [ ] Event-driven storage notifications
- [ ] Cross-domain storage access tests

## Additional Components

- [ ] Storage metric collection
- [ ] Backup and retention implementation
- [ ] Storage usage limits and quotas
- [ ] URL expiration management

## Testing and Validation

- [ ] Storage performance testing
- [ ] Storage security audit (with focus on Guard layer security)
- [ ] Multi-user access testing
- [ ] Programmatic access control verification
- [ ] Integration tests for all domains

## Next Steps for Implementation

1. Complete the remaining domain-specific storage services with strong Guard layer implementation
2. Create domain agent prompts for each storage service
3. Implement service tests with focus on security validation
4. Test cross-domain storage interactions
5. Develop comprehensive security testing for the no-RLS approach

This checklist covers the foundational storage components, which are now complete, and outlines the next steps for implementing domain-specific storage services. The Project domain has been implemented as the first example, and the remaining domains should follow the same pattern.
